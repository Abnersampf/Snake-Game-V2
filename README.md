# Snake-Game-V2
This is my second version of the snake game. My only aim with this version was to reduce the number of lines of code compared to the other one.  This version uses a different movement and rendering mechanism, which makes it lighter. The game is not 100% complete.

ABOUT THE GAME:
- No game over system yet;
- No auto collision system yet;

IMPORTANT:
- Use .NET 7.0;
- This code does not work in online compilers (compile on your machine);
- I recommend using Visual Studio;
- Don't run this program in your IDE's terminal, look for the .exe file that was generated (after compiling) and run it.
